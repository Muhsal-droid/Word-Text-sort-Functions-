To run the code, you have to use the makefile.
There are several ways in which you can use a makefile.
Firstly, if you want to execute all files, then type "make all" in the terminal and it creates executables files for your use.
Secondly, if you want to make an individuL executable file, then simple type in the terminal "make" with the filename you intend to use.
Thirdly, if you want to remove all the executable file sand make the directory clean, type in "make clean" and it does it for you.
That is how you use the makefile, but you also can use other commands.
This includes " make findWords,wordBag" and you can execute them separeately as well.
